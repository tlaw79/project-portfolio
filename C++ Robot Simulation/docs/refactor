Refactoring Iteration 3
Tyler Law
CSCI 3081

Class: Arena.cc, Arena.h
Method: UpdateEntitiesTimestep

The entire method UpdateEntitiesTimestep was partitioned into new function calls.
The methods UpdateHungerTimers, HandleCollisions, UpdateSensorPositions and
UpdateSensorReadings are new and contain subroutines which used to be used as
in-line code in the method UpdateEntitiesTimestep, but are now called as functions
instead.  I changed the order of the subroutines a little bit in order to organize
them in a more logical way.

I chose this refactoring because the method UpdateEntitiesTimestep used to be
one of the longest methods in the entire code base, and because it is the
update loop for everything in the simulation.  It contained several functionally
distinct sections of code that could be quickly and easily contained within
their own functions with no parameters and no return value.  The end result is a
short, readable and easily understood update loop.
